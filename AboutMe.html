                <p class="parag">My name is Nick, and I am full stack software developer with a specialty in .NET. I'm driven by a curiosity and desire to constantly improve my skills, learn about new technologies, and make the world a better and more productive place. As a high school teacher turned software developer I have an interesting set of skills and views going into the software development field. I think the world can grow and learn best from the continued use and widespread understanding of the impact software has on everyone's life in the modern day. This is why I am passionate about being the best developer I can be.</p>
              <p class="parag">To be more specific with my skills, within the .NET framework I am most comfortable writing applications in C#, Javascript, and SQL. Over in my projects you can see some of these skills on display. There you will find links to repositories for several projects I have done over the last half a year or so. These include database management as well as backend development in C#, and front end desgin in JavaScript and JQuery. Additionally in my most recent project I have build a service for communicating with foreign API's. Moving into the future I am excited to learn more languages, and to imporve on the skills I have in those I have started with.</p>
